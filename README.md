# Ops Logger

A comprehensive terminal logging solution for red team operations with tmux integration.

## Info

Currently the operator log csv works great. However, the venbose logging has a sync issue where if you run commands too quickly it may mix up output. The recording feature is still a work in progress

## Overview

Ops Logger provides automated logging and recording of terminal sessions during security operations. It captures commands, outputs, and full terminal recordings for documentation, evidence gathering, and audit trails.

Key features:
- **Shell-Agnostic**: Works with bash and zsh shells running inside tmux
- **Command Logging**: Records all commands with timestamps, user, path, and output to CSV and verbose logs
- **Normalized Pane IDs**: Uses predictable session-window-pane format (e.g., `main-0-0`)
- **Terminal Recording**: Supports asciinema recordings with fallback to basic frame capture
- **tmux Integration**: Seamless integration with tmux including Oh My Tmux! configurations
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows ðŸ”´ logging and ðŸŽ¥ recording indicators in window names
- **Engagement-Aware**: Target-based organization for better log management
- **Minimal ANSI Cleaning**: Preserves command output while removing terminal control sequences

```

### Key Bindings

Once installed, the following tmux key bindings are available:

- **Prefix + L**: Toggle command logging for the current pane
- **Prefix + R**: Toggle terminal recording for the current pane

Note: "Prefix" refers to your tmux prefix key (default: Ctrl+b).

## tmux Configuration Compatibility

### Oh My Tmux! Users

Ops Logger automatically detects and integrates with Oh My Tmux! configurations. The keybindings are installed without conflicting with existing Oh My Tmux! features.

### Custom tmux Configurations

If you have a custom tmux setup, the installer will add these keybindings:

```bash
# Automatically added by --install
bind-key L run-shell "'/path/to/ops-logger.sh' --toggle"
bind-key R run-shell "'/path/to/ops-logger.sh' --toggle-recording"
```

### Custom Key Bindings

You can manually set different keys if L and R conflict with your setup:

```bash
# Example with different keys in .tmux.conf
bind-key O run-shell "~/ops-logger.sh --toggle"
bind-key P run-shell "~/ops-logger.sh --toggle-recording"
```

## First-Time Setup

On first run, Ops Logger will:
1. Prompt for configuration setup
2. Ask for target name (defaults to `target-hostname`)
3. Set log directory (defaults to `~/OperationLogs`)
4. Create configuration file at `~/.ops-logger.conf`

Reconfigure at any time with:
```bash
./ops-logger.sh --config
```

## Workflow Examples

### Basic Operation Logging

1. Start tmux: `tmux`
2. Press `Prefix + L` to start logging
3. Window title shows ðŸ”´ indicator when logging is active
4. All commands and outputs are automatically logged
5. Logs saved to `~/OperationLogs/`

### Recording Remote Sessions

1. SSH to target: `ssh user@target`
2. Press `Prefix + R` to start recording
3. Window title shows ðŸŽ¥ indicator when recording
4. Perform operations (everything is captured)
5. Press `Prefix + R` again to stop
6. Recording saved to `~/OperationLogs/recordings/`

### Multiple Pane Operations

Ops Logger works independently in each tmux pane:
- Each pane gets its own normalized ID (e.g., `main-0-0`, `main-0-1`)
- Logging and recording can be enabled per-pane
- Visual indicators show status for each pane

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.ops-logger.conf`:

```bash
# Ops Logger Configuration
TARGET_NAME="target-example"
LOG_DIR="/home/user/OperationLogs"
PROMPT_NEW_SHELLS=true
RECORD_INTERVAL=0.5
DEBUG=false
```

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TARGET_NAME` | `target-hostname` | Identifier for logs and recordings |
| `LOG_DIR` | `~/OperationLogs` | Base directory for all logs |
| `PROMPT_NEW_SHELLS` | `true` | Ask to enable logging in new panes |
| `RECORD_INTERVAL` | `0.5` | Seconds between frames in basic recording |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues |

## Shell Compatibility

Ops Logger currently supports:
- **Bash**: Full support with history-based command detection
- **Zsh**: Full support with preexec/precmd hooks
- **Other shells**: May work but not specifically tested

The tool hooks into shell command execution and tmux output capture, making it work across different shell environments.

## Log Structure

```
~/OperationLogs/
â”œâ”€â”€ target-name_commands_YYYY-MM-DD.csv        # CSV command log
â”œâ”€â”€ verbose/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ target-name_verbose_YYYY-MM-DD.log     # Detailed command/output logs
â””â”€â”€ recordings/
    â”œâ”€â”€ target-name_main-0-0_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.cast      # Asciinema files
    â””â”€â”€ target-name_main-0-0_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/           # Basic recordings
        â”œâ”€â”€ info.txt                            # Recording metadata
        â””â”€â”€ frames/                             # Individual frame captures
```

### CSV Log Format

The CSV log contains essential command information:
```csv
"StartTime","EndTime","SourceIP","User","Path","Command"
"2023-12-01 10:30:15","2023-12-01 10:30:16","192.168.1.100","user","/home/user","ls -la"
```

### Verbose Log Format

Detailed logs with command context and output:
```
==============================================================================
COMMAND EXECUTION - 2023-12-01 10:30:15
==============================================================================
Command: ls -la

Path: /home/user
Start: 2023-12-01 10:30:15
End: 2023-12-01 10:30:16
Pane: main-0-0

```

## Viewing Recordings

### Asciinema Recordings

```bash
# Play recording
asciinema play ~/OperationLogs/recordings/target-name_*.cast

# Upload to asciinema.org (if appropriate)
asciinema upload ~/OperationLogs/recordings/target-name_*.cast
```

### Basic Recordings

Basic recordings are stored as individual frame captures with metadata. They can be processed or viewed using the captured frame data.

## Status Indicators

Ops Logger provides visual feedback through tmux window names:
- **ðŸ”´ [window-name]**: Logging is active in this window
- **ðŸŽ¥ [window-name]**: Recording is active in this window
- **ðŸ”´ðŸŽ¥ [window-name]**: Both logging and recording are active

## Requirements

- **tmux** (required)
- **bash** or **zsh** (for command hooks)
- **curl** (for public IP detection)
- **asciinema** (optional, for high-quality recordings)

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Mode

```bash
./ops-logger.sh --debug-on
./ops-logger.sh --status
# Check ~/OperationLogs/ops-logger-debug.log for details
```

### Common Issues

1. **Keybindings not working:**
   ```bash
   # Check if bindings are installed
   tmux list-keys | grep ops
   
   # Manually reinstall
   ./ops-logger.sh --uninstall
   ./ops-logger.sh --install
   ```

2. **No output in logs:**
   - Enable debug mode to see what's happening
   - Check that shell hooks are properly installed
   - Verify the pane ID matches between status and logs

3. **Recording issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check asciinema installation
   which asciinema
   
   # Try basic recording mode if asciinema fails
   # (automatically falls back)
   ```

4. **Permission issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check log directory permissions
   ls -la ~/OperationLogs/
   
   # Recreate if needed
   rm -rf ~/OperationLogs/
   ./ops-logger.sh --start
   ```

### Complete Removal

```bash
# Stop all logging and remove everything
./ops-logger.sh --uninstall-all

# This removes:
# - tmux keybindings
# - configuration file
# - debug logs
# - temporary files
```

## ShellOpsLog Compatibility

Ops Logger includes compatibility with the ShellOpsLog API:

```bash
# Source the script for compatibility functions
source ops-logger.sh

# Use ShellOpsLog-style commands
start_operation_log
start_operation_log -AutoStart
stop_operation_log
```

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Logs may contain passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information
- **Log Storage**: Consider encrypting logs at rest for sensitive operations
- **Network Traffic**: Public IP detection makes outbound connections
- **File Permissions**: Log files inherit standard user permissions
- **Remote Logging**: Be aware of what's being captured during SSH sessions

## Performance

Ops Logger is designed to be lightweight:
- Minimal CPU overhead during normal operation
- Output buffering prevents excessive I/O
- Configurable recording intervals for basic recording mode
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
